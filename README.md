# sawfish-ext

Some scripts for sawfish that might be useful enough to publish.

* `messages.jl`: A general message window API
* `window-mode.jl`: A togglable "window-mode" with customizable keymap, meant for carrying a separate set of bindings for manipulating windows.  Since this alters the global keymap, it might in theory blow away your keybindings, so beware.
